# Description 
 I am delighted to present my latest Data Science Project : Black Friday Sales Prediction.

ðŸ”µ The aim of this project is to Predict the purchase amount of customers during Black Friday sales events. The endeavor begins with an exhaustive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset, focusing on understanding the influence of key features such as Gender, Age, Occupation, City Category, Stay in Current City Years, Marital Status, and Product Category on purchase behavior.



ðŸ”µ The project employs advanced Data Encoding Techniques, specifically Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding, to transform categorical data into numerical representations, ensuring compatibility with machine learning models.



ðŸ”µ To address data integrity, missing values are handled through imputation techniques, preserving data completeness for accurate analysis and modeling.



ðŸ”µ  Model Building: 

Decision Tree algorithm and Random Forest algorithm
